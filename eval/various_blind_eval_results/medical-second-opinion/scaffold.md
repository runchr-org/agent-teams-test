# Live Ejentum Scaffold (mode: reasoning-multi)

The agent chose `reasoning-multi` mode based on the skill file's Single vs Multi decision table (the medical case spans causal + temporal + abstraction dimensions). The scaffold below is the raw API response, injected into the agent's context as a `role: tool` message before it generated its final answer.

**Agent-crafted query:**
Patient is a 45-year-old male reporting sluggishness. Lab results show fasting glucose at 108 mg/dL, HbA1c at 5.8%, LDL cholesterol at 145 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol at 38 mg/dL, triglycerides at 180 mg/dL, and vitamin D at 22 ng/mL. Primary physician recommended better diet and exercise.

**API response:**

[PROCEDURE]
Step 1: Map the current knowledge frontier and identify gaps where information is missing or uncertain. Step 2: Rank each gap by expected value, estimating how much resolution would advance the goal. Step 3: Identify the most efficient foraging strategy for the top-ranked gap, choosing between inference, analogy, or decomposition. Step 4: Verify that foraging effort targets high-value gaps. If effort drifts to low-value areas, halt and redirect. Step 5: Extract acquired information and integrate it before pursuing the next gap. Step 6: Never allow aimless information gathering. If epistemic ceiling persists after directed foraging, flag the limit and constrain scope. Amplify variable seeking.

Test: compare the information value of what was gained against the highest-ranked remaining gap.} --working→ S1[LOOP:convergence] --failing→ FREEFORM{The frontier has not advanced because I am foraging low-value gaps. I am data-starved on the important question and distracted by tractable trivia. I must abandon the current foraging path and redirect to the top-ranked gap even if it requires a harder strategy.} → RE-ENTER at S2 --no→ MOD:saturation(diminishing_returns→EXIT) → OUT:knowledge_state

[FALSIFICATION TEST]
If a conclusion is drawn from insufficient data without verifying first directing a search for the missing information, foraging direction was skipped.
